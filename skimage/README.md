# viscosity
methods for contour coordinates/viscosity measurements

# Summary for what this code does and the next steps

# I film the rotation, save the video and add it to the pycharm folder, add 'name of video' to FRAME_EXTRACTION.PY.
# This takes all frames out of video

# For now, I'm selecting only a few of the images, change .png to .jpg, and using trial and error with FINDING_CROP.PY
# and ROTATING_IMAGE.PY to get consistent ROIs and positioning of the vial to previous frames of the same video

# Then, I use CONTOUR_COORDINATES.PY to get the .csv file of the XY coords. (sometimes filtering doesn't work so I use
# trial and error again)

# Next step: Extracting the necessary information from the .csv files
